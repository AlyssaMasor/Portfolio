    Once upon a time, I was an itinerant Yiddish teacher.  Somehow I ended up working for the health department.  A proud nerd, I would sit every evening doing Duolingo, when suddenly it occured to me that maybe I would enjoy computer languages as well.  Lo and behold, after trying out javascript, my suspicions were confirmed and here I am.
